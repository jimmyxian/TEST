Hi, all
I have some questions that many people ask me in China. And I want listen to your answers. :)
(1) What is the difference between Swarm and Kubernetes? Advantage and Disadvantage? In Which situation, should use Swarm?
(2) In Swarm roadmap(The first integration will be Mesos but other tools will arrive after, like Kubernetes), 
    we can find that swarm will integrate Kubernetes. Do you have some details infomation about this. How, When?
(3) When swarm can be Readay for production? 
(4) Any company have already use swarm? 
(5) Max Swarm cluster size?
