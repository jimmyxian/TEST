i, Andrea
I'm jimmyxian, this is my another email. Last month, Katya sent me an email and ask me where i'm based, she can introduce me to right people in China Docker Meeting Up.
Unfortunately, I replied Katya, but seems not send succefully. There are somethings wrong with my email "xianchaobo@huawei.com", I lost all the emails including here email address. I don't have her email address now. :(
Could you help me to reply to her "I'm in Xi'an China, already join in Xi'an Docker Meeting up(http://www.meetup.com/Docker-Xian/events/221991060/) ", and let her reply to this email "xianchaobo@gmail.com". Thanks.

Anyway, I will introduce our swarm to others in Xi'an Docker Meeting up in next weekends. :)
Here is the topic in Meeting up, I'm the second one.
(1)Simplify openstack deployment based on container by Bo Hai (Hua Wei)
(2)Introduce to swarm by Jimmy Xian (Hua Wei)
(3)How Docker change software infrastructure by Frank Yu (DaoCloud)
(4)Micro-service paractice in ThoughtWorks (TBC)

Aslo, I find this (http://blog.docker.com/2015/05/online-meetup-recap-docker-swarm-0-2-0/), can you send the PPT(Introduction to swarm) to me, I want copy some picture to my PPT. :)

Thanks very much.
